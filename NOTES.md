# Time complexity

The optimal solution has O(n) time complexity, as it loops over all nodes in the linked list

# Space complexity

It has O(1) space complexity as the amount of memory required does not increase with the length of the linked list

# First solution

First solution works with the same time complexity, but space complexity is O(n) because we create a separate `bits` list which grows with the linked list length
